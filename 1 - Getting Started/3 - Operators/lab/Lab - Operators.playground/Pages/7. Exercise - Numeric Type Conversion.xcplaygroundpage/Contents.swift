 ## Exercise - Numeric Type Conversion

 Create an integer constant `x` with a value of 10, and a double constant `y` with a value of 3.2. Create a constant `multipliedAsIntegers` equal to `x` times `y`. Does this compile? If not, fix it by converting your `Double` to an `Int` in the mathematical expression. Print the result.
 */
let x = Double(10)
let y = Double(3.2)
let multipliedAsIntegers = x * y
print(multipliedAsIntegers)
/*:
 Create a constant `multipliedAsDoubles` equal to `x` times `y`, but this time convert the `Int` to a `Double` in the expression. Print the result.
 */
let multipliedAsDoubles = x * y
print(multipliedAsDoubles)
/*:
 Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
 */
print("They are different because the compiler cannot multiply an integer and double value while the 2 double values were able to compile")
